This is my final project of school and use React & Redux. Bite Bank is a media storage platform dedicated to the culinary arts. It allows for quick reference to cooking videos of interest by keeping a record of those you would like to flag and return to in the future. Easily searchable by name, category, and ethnicityâ€¦Bite Bank is a useful tool for any chef!
